# SCRS Overview - Streamlined Company Registration Service
--------------

As part of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 there is the requirement to deliver a 
system for streamlined company registration. This is to include registration in terms of :

* incorporation with Companies House as part of documents which must be delivered to the registrar under section
   9 of the Companies Act 2006 (registration documents) in respect of the formation of a company.
* registration for taxes with HMRC for purposes connected with VAT, corporation tax and PAYE.

For the purposes of the legislation, streamlined means that all registration information can be provided on a 
single occasion to a single recipient and by electronic means.

This service is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), so needs at least a [JRE] to run.
